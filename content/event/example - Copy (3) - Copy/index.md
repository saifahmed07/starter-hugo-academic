abstract: A surge of bots, trolls, and fake news on social media platforms has fuelled suspicion, disrupted conversations, and undermined civic trust. In the present day, the most novel and technologically superior form of fake news are AI-generated deepfakes. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how online users engage with this newer form of disinformation. In this talk, Dr. Ahmed will discuss a series of studies exploring the public perception of deepfakes and examining who shares deepfakes on social media and why they do so. He will also discuss the implications of such disinformation sharing behavior. The findings are drawn from empirical studies of social media users in Singapore and the United States.
